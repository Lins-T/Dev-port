      <p>
        The combined experience i have working at the top fortune 500 companies has allowed me to develop a skillset
        that helps me not just in development, but in every aspect of development.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm proud to announce that I'm now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about
        how to <i> sell</i> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.
      </p>
      
      <br />
      <br />
      
      <p>
        As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.
        <br />
        <br />

          your skills and become a leader in something <i>you're</i> passionate about.
